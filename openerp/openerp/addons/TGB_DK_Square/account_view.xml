                Define your company's financial year according to your needs. A
                financial year is a period at the end of which a company's
                accounts are made up (usually 12 months). The financial year is
                usually referred to by the date in which it ends. For example,
                if a company's financial year ends November 30, 2011, then
                everything between December 1, 2010 and November 30, 2011
                would be referred to as FY 2011.
